            <p> Hi! I'm Luke Phillips. I am a full stack web developer based in Colorado Springs. I recently graduated from DU's web dev bootcamp and am transitioning into the world of tech. My background has been in sales for the past few years. I'm a people person first and foremost, but but I also have the kind of mind that needs continuous problems to solve (ideally problems I choose!)</p>
        <p>I also love the outdoors and appreciating music and other forms of art. In my freetime, you can find me deep in an audiobook while walking the neighborhood with my daughter, playing the guitar/piano/flute with my band of friends, or networking to find independent web developing contracts.</p>
        <p>Anyways, thanks for visiting! Feel free to peek around and see my work</p>
